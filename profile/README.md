## Resourcecode description

RESOURCECODE aims to support investment and growth in the wave and tidal energy sector through the creation of an integrated marine data toolbox. The toolbox consist of modelling and software tools, available via this online platform.

The database has been released early 2022, providing 27 years of model data, creating the highest resolution wave model in North West Europe. The toolbox enables resource characterisation, and allows technology developers and supply chain companies to improve engineering designs and optimise operations in highly demanding marine environments, increasing the confidence of potential investors.

RESOURCECODE drives forward the development and validation of cutting-edge resource modelling techniques using partner data from the laboratory, existing models, satellites and the extensive MetOcean data sets held by the test sites. Central to this is the development and expansion of Ifremerâ€™s flagship HOMERE MetOcean hindcast database to cover the waters around the west coast of France and the English Channel. The project provides a high-resolution, validated, transparent and reliable marine renewable energy wave and current resource data to the industry.

Data analysis tools have been developed to provide cutting-edge statistical analysis techniques for these expanded data sets and those provided through the test sites. The specification for these tools have been be identified and developed through dedicated commercialisation studies guided by a multi-user steering group including certification companies and a number of technology developers active in the wave and tidal energy sector.
